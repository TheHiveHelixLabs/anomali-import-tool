- Infrastructure Layers (Multiple specialized assemblies)
- Presentation Layer (WPF)

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved testability through dependency inversion
- Framework independence
- Better maintainability
- Easier to understand and modify

**Negative**:
- Initial complexity and learning curve
- More projects to manage
- Potential over-engineering for simple features

**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

Manual service registration in dependency injection containers becomes tedious and error-prone as the application grows. We need a way to automatically register services.

### Decision

Implement assembly scanning with:
- `ServiceRegistrationAttribute` for marking services
- Convention-based registration
- Automatic interface-to-implementation mapping
- Configurable service lifetimes

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Reduces boilerplate code
- Convention over configuration
- Easier to maintain
- Consistent registration patterns
- Less prone to registration errors

**Negative**:
- Less explicit about what services are registered
- Potential performance impact during startup
- Magic behavior that may be harder to debug

## ADR-005: Architecture Fitness Functions

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

Architecture tends to degrade over time without active monitoring. We need a way to continuously validate that architectural decisions are being followed.

### Decision

Implement automated architecture fitness functions using NetArchTest.Rules:
- Clean Architecture dependency validation
- Naming convention enforcement
- Design pattern compliance
- Security and performance checks

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Prevents architecture drift
- Continuous validation of design decisions
- Early detection of violations
- Living documentation of constraints
- CI/CD integration for automated checks

**Negative**:
- Additional test maintenance overhead
- May slow down development initially
- False positives may require test refinement

## ADR-006: WPF for Desktop Presentation Layer

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

The application needs a desktop user interface for threat bulletin management. Options considered included WPF, WinUI 3, Avalonia, and web-based solutions.

### Decision

Use WPF with MVVM pattern for the presentation layer.

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Mature and stable framework
- Rich ecosystem and tooling
- Good performance for desktop applications
- Strong data binding capabilities
- Familiar to .NET developers

**Negative**:
- Windows-only platform
- Legacy framework (though still supported)
- Limited modern UI capabilities compared to newer frameworks

## ADR-007: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

The application needs persistent storage for threat bulletins, documents, and metadata. We need to choose a database and ORM strategy.

### Decision

Use PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core for data persistence.

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Robust and reliable database
- Excellent performance for complex queries
- Strong consistency guarantees
- Good tooling and ecosystem
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Negative**:
