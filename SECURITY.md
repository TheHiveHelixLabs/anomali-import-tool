Instead, report security issues privately using one of these methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourdomain.com]
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use the [Security Advisory](../../security/advisories/new) feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use our PGP key for sensitive reports

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
- **Your Contact Information**: For follow-up questions

### 🕐 Response Timeline

We are committed to responding quickly to security reports:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage and Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Within 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### 🏆 Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our security:

- **Security Hall of Fame**: Listed in our security acknowledgments
- **CVE Assignment**: For qualifying vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security
- Download only from official sources (GitHub Releases)
- Verify file hashes and digital signatures
- Use administrator privileges only when necessary
- Install in secure directories with appropriate permissions

#### Configuration Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for ThreatStream accounts
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) where available
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials
- Store configuration files in secure locations

#### Operational Security
- Keep the application updated to the latest version
- Monitor system logs for unusual activity
- Use encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all API communications
- Implement network segmentation where appropriate

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive documents before processing
- Use secure file deletion for temporary files
- Implement proper access controls for processed data
- Regular backup and secure storage of audit logs

### For Developers

#### Secure Development
- Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Apply principle of least privilege

#### Code Review
- All code changes require security review
- Use static analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL)
- Implement automated security testing in CI/CD
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

#### Secrets Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use secure secret management systems
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Implement proper secret access controls
