# Product Requirements Document: Anomali Threat Bulletin Import Tool

## Introduction/Overview

The Anomali Threat Bulletin Import Tool is a fully portable, standalone Windows application designed to run from any location including USB drives, network shares, or local directories without installation. The tool streamlines the process of importing threat intelligence documents into Anomali ThreatStream by providing automated extraction, intelligent grouping, and bulk import capabilities with customizable naming schemes and attachment handling. The application is completely self-contained with zero dependencies on system installations or registry entries.

## Goals

2. **Intelligent Grouping**: Automatically group related documents into single threat bulletins based on configurable rules
3. **Data Extraction**: Extract key metadata (dates, usernames, ticket numbers) from documents for automated naming
4. **Flexible Integration**: Support multiple Anomali API versions and instances
5. **Audit Compliance**: Maintain NIST-compliant security practices and comprehensive audit trails
6. **Error Resilience**: Provide fallback options for failed imports and clear user feedback
7. **Version Control Integration**: Automatically commit and push completed tasks to Git repositories for seamless development workflow
8. **Complete Portability**: Run from any location (USB drives, network shares, local directories) without installation or system dependencies

3. **As a security analyst**, I want to extract usernames from documents and create separate bulletins for each user so that threats are properly attributed
4. **As a security administrator**, I want to configure custom naming templates so that bulletins follow our organization's naming conventions
5. **As a security analyst**, I want to preview and confirm imports before submission so that I can verify data accuracy
6. **As a compliance officer**, I want comprehensive audit trails of all import activities so that we maintain proper documentation
7. **As a developer**, I want the system to automatically commit and push my completed work to Git so that version control is maintained without manual intervention
8. **As a project manager**, I want automatic Git integration to track task completion and maintain code history for project oversight
9. **As a security analyst**, I want to run the application directly from a USB drive on any Windows machine without requiring installation or administrative privileges
10. **As an IT administrator**, I want to deploy the application to network shares so users can run it directly without local installation or system modifications
11. **As a field analyst**, I want to carry the application on portable media and use it on different systems without leaving traces or requiring system changes
