## Goals

1. **Automate Document Import**: Reduce manual effort by 90% when importing threat bulletins from document repositories
2. **Intelligent Grouping**: Automatically group related documents into single threat bulletins based on configurable rules
3. **Data Extraction**: Extract key metadata (dates, usernames, ticket numbers) from documents for automated naming
4. **Flexible Integration**: Support multiple Anomali API versions and instances
5. **Audit Compliance**: Maintain NIST-compliant security practices and comprehensive audit trails
6. **Error Resilience**: Provide fallback options for failed imports and clear user feedback
7. **Version Control Integration**: Automatically commit and push completed tasks to Git repositories for seamless development workflow
